- description: MindfulHacks, Singaporeâ€™s first student-run mental health hackathon, was founded to encourage innovation of solutions to mental health issues and empower students from all backgrounds to take action for causes they care about and combat the stigma of mental illness. As a student-run hackathon, we aim to persuade everyone, including programming beginners, that anyone is able to code. We aim to reach over 100 students from Polytechnics, Universities and Junior Colleges.
